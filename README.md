# FNAF-Autosplitter
a livesplit autosplitter for fnaf to make using a timer more consistent for strategies.

It will automatically start the timer when you load into a night and can reset your timer when you die or complete the night.

### As of Now This Only Works For FNAF 2

I plan on adding the other games later and will update this as I add each game in and fix any posted bugs. Please let me know if there are any problems and I will try to fix them the best I can

# How to Download
To start, download the `fnaf.asl` file and save it somewhere you can find it.

Next, Open Livesplit and right click on your timer and go to "Edit Layout"

Then, if you don't already have one. click the plus go to "Control" and then click on "Scriptable Auto Splitter"

Now double-click "Scriptable Auto Splitter" in the list and when the window pops up click browse next to "Script Path" and find and select `fnaf.asl`.

Finally make sure the "Start" check-box is checked and if you would like you can turn the reset on or off.
